      <h2>
            Brush Accuracy
         </h2>
         <p>Brushes are now saved with precise vertex data in the VMF.<br>
         This means that vertices stay perfectly preserved between sessions, instead of 'drifting away'.<br>
         Imprecise old data is still saved for compilers and compatibility with other Hammers.<br>
         Imprecise data is also more accurately read in Hammer++, mitigating vertex drift significantly.<br>
         Precise data can be toggled in options if you don't want to use it for any reason.<br>

         Gizmo can be toggled to use either Global or Local transformations, either by clicking the new icon in the toolbar,
         or pressing the Ctrl + J keybind.<br>
         The Gizmo can be locked to the X, Y or Z axes, or a combination of the two.<br>
         The X key will cycle between 3 edit modes: none, box (old workflow) and gizmo.<br>
         Pressing right click will cycle between translation, rotation and scaling.<br>

         </h2>
         <p>Accessible under Tools -> Keybind Editor, allows you to edit most keybindings in Hammer++.<br>
         Unfortunately due to limitations in Hammer's UI, the following quirks are present:<br>
         Modifiers (CTRL, ALT, SHIFT) may not work on all bindings,<br>
         Some bindings require a refresh of any open maps to take effect,<br>
         Mouse bindings are not possible to edit/assign.<br>
