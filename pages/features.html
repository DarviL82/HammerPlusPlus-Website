               Brush Accuracy
            </h2>
            <p>Brushes are now saved with precise vertex data in the VMF.<br>
				This means that vertices stay perfectly preserved between sessions, instead of 'drifting away'.<br>
				Imprecise old data is still saved for compilers and compatibility with other Hammers.<br>
				Imprecise data is also more accurately read in Hammer++, mitigating vertex drift significantly.<br>
				Precise data can be toggled in options if you don't want to use it for any reason.<br>
				Drag the slider in the comparison to see the difference when saving a cone brush in vanilla Hammer vs Hammer++.
